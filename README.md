##About
This project's goal is to leverage the **SolarEdge** API using **Google Scripts** to pull data into a **Google Sheets** spreadsheet.  Once in the spreadsheet, you can choose to do whatever you'd like with the data.  Using **Google Sheets Triggers**, you can trigger a series of scripts to execute at an interval you define.  For example, during a particular time of day, once a day, once a week, on load, etc.

If your utility provider also provides an API, you can combine the information from your SolarEdge inverter with that from your utility provider.
